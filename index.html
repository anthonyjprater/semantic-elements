            So you're sitting in HTML 100 trying to enumerate on the differences between Git and Github... when suddenly a classmate ask the instructor about <i><a href="https://codepen.io/mi-lee/post/an-overview-of-html5-semantics"> semantics </a></i> in HTML5.
            <br>Now hang on and don't log out of the Zoom meeting just, yet. Semantics can give you a new outlook on development. Or lack thereof could land you into the world of <mark>divitis</mark>.

        <p>
            The beauty of semantic elements is the easy road map which they lay for your web design process to be content  driven.
            <br>Let's be honest a beautifully styled web page can become pretty useless if the content isn't easily understood or accessible.

            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML">Accessibilty</a> is arguably the second best thing about using semantic elements to markup your website.
            <br>You want visitors to be able to interact with your site in the most basic ways as possible and then work it out in your design process. Which would be easier to identify
            <br>and style because of the use of semantic elements and would give team members a story without the need for bread crumbs when collaborating.
