      <h1>What's the Deal with Semantics?</h1>
    </header>
    <p>So you're sitting in HTML 100 trying to enumerate on the differences between Git and Github... when suddenly a classmate ask the instructor about <i><a href="https://codepen.io/mi-lee/post/an-overview-of-html5-semantics"> semantics </a></i>in HTML5.
      <br>
    Now hang on and don't log out of the Zoom meeting just, yet. Semantics can give you a new outlook on development. Or lack thereof could land you into the world of divitis.</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://csscreator.com/divitis">"Divitis is a common problem with webdesigners. It is the process of using too many nested/unnecessary divs to mark up a page."

      <p>The beauty of semantic elements is the easy road map which they lay for your web design process to be content driven.
        <br>

      <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML">Accessibilty</a> is arguably the second best thing about using semantic elements to markup your website.
        <br>
        You want visitors to be able to interact with your site in the most basic ways as possible and then work it out in your design process. Which would be easier to identify
        <br>and style because of the use of semantic elements.

      <h4>The benefits extend beyond basic interaction to:</h4>
